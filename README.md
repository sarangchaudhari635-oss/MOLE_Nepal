## 📖 Overview

**ScrapIQ** (formerly MOLE / CirculaNet) is a modern, enterprise-grade SaaS platform built to solve the industrial waste problem. Instead of letting valuable byproducts and industrial scrap go to landfills, ScrapIQ bridges the gap between waste generators and recyclers.

Our intelligent **matching engine** automatically ranks and connects sellers with buyers based on physical location proximity, material compatibility, and chemical composition—turning waste into revenue.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Material Matching:** Intelligently pairs industrial waste generators with buyers based on exact material needs, quantities, and quality constraints.
- 📍 **Proximity-Based Sorting:** Automatically detecting and sorting matches by physical distance to minimize logistics costs and carbon footprints (e.g., `45 km away`).
- ⚡ **Real-Time B2B Messaging:** Integrated chat and negotiation tools to quickly finalize "Offers" and material exchange pathways.
- 📊 **Smart Dashboard & Reporting:** Tracks CO2 saved, cost reductions, and operational metrics with a clean, industrial SaaS aesthetic.
- 🔍 **Google-Style Pagination:** Seamlessly browse through hundreds of matching waste streams with intuitive UI pagination.
- 🌎 **Eco-Tech Aesthetics:** A premium, fully responsive design utilizing minimalist whitespaces, "glassmorphism" layers, and vibrant emerald accents.
